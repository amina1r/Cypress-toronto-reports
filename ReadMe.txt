Welcome to Cypress- an interactive web app that allows users to report issues, 
which are sent directly to the City of Toronto. 

This package includes:
    - a product backlog listing all the distinct functionalities of the application
    - a test log to ensure functionalities are implemented and working correctly
    - a short video displaying the general prototype and a simulation of a user's 
      experience with Cypress
